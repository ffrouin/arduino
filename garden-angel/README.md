#  Garden Angel for Arduino Uno release 0.1

The garden angel is an electronic system that monitor air humidity,
temperature and light. Data is acquired every second. Due to the low
level of available memory on board, system is actually able to store
36 hours of data with a point every 28 minutes. Data stored is an average
value of the collected data over the storage period.

You can adujst the history length and the archive size if your board as
more memory available, you may get best data resolution in the data
history. Do not forget to recompile with your local time in order the
board to report correct timestamp. All this has to be configured in the
history.h file :

	time_t LOCAL_TIME=1475397109; // 2 oct 2016, 10:31:~47 (UTC+0200)
	
	const int HIST_CAPACITY=76; // history table index size
	float HIST_LENGTH=86400*1.5; // history length in seconds
	int HIST_PERIOD=int (HIST_LENGTH/HIST_CAPACITY);

The board will report to you on the serial console the number of day available
for data storage and the history resolution in minutes.

To display the history, just push the button on board until next data
acquisition and you'll get a CSV output of collected data on the serial
console of the board.
